            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They killed one of our Gunners at the great Mount, 3 or 4 private Souldiers, and wounded Å¿ome few, and diÅ¿mounted one of our Pieces, and Å¿plit the muzzle; but we anÅ¿wered them again, and gave them three Å¿hots for one,

               <p>Their chief Work which doth moÅ¿t annoy us, is their new Sconce which they have raiÅ¿ed oppoÅ¿ite to our great Mount, one <hi>ThompÅ¿on</hi> a Gunner Å¿upplying the Å¿ame<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> who is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Engineer, and an admirable marks man, and hath endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered two or three eminent Commanders; but one Mr. Smith, Gentleman of the Pikes to Col. <hi>Ewers</hi> Company, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ired leave to make a Å¿hot againÅ¿t the Å¿aid Sconce, which accordingly was granten, and indeed it proved an excellent one; for he diÅ¿mounted one of their great braÅ¿Å¿e Pieces, &amp; (its Å¿aid) wounded the Å¿aid <hi>ThompÅ¿on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have Å¿tormed one of their Å¿trongeÅ¿t Fortifications, neer the town, but before we could gain it, we had a hard diÅ¿putation, they knockt us off of our ladders, and threw down great Å¿tones and brick-bats upon us, and defended it with great reÅ¿olution; till at the laÅ¿t our men Å¿et to their ladders again, and up they went with great fury and reÅ¿olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and got up to the Battlemens of the Gate-houÅ¿e, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting Granados out of their hands over amongÅ¿t the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and one of the Å¿aid Granadoes falling into a roome where their Magazine lay, blew up divers barrels of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and about 60. Souldiers, giving a moÅ¿t great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blow.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the reÅ¿t of their men that defended the Å¿aid Fortification cryed out for quarter, but not above 12. men were left of 150. a very Å¿ad Å¿pectacle to behold. Some arms were taken, but moÅ¿t of them Å¿poyled with the blow.</p>
               <p>This was a very conÅ¿iderable place, add advantagious to the Enemy, the loÅ¿Å¿e of which did infuÅ¿e a great deale of wrath and terrour in the heart of Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed him to make a deÅ¿perate Å¿alley out upon us, but were repulÅ¿ed and beaten in with loÅ¿Å¿e.</p>

               <p>They have Å¿everall advantages to play upon us, which doth embolden them the more, and upon TueÅ¿day morning laÅ¿t, before the <hi>Trevalle</hi> had beat, Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> Å¿allyed out in perÅ¿on himÅ¿elf, together with Gen. <hi>HaÅ¿tings,</hi> Col. <hi>Luns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and divers other perÅ¿ons of quality, with about 400.
